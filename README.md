# dictionary
Dicitonary implementation using Trie data structure



Project Definition:

We have implemented a Dictionary with the help of Trie Data structure.We’ve used a
“data.txt” file for a database of english dictionary which consists of around 3000 words.
When a user searches a word, it gives its respective meaning. Similarly if the user enters a
prefix of word, it shows all the related words starting with the given prefix. Insertion
functionality is also given.

Note: As .txt file was not supported on LMS, we’ve uploaded the database file as
“data.docx”. Please rename and save it as “data.txt” (.txt file) to see proper execution of
code or else it would generate an error.
Also, we’ve created a full explanatory video of our program of about 20 minutes. But even
after compressing it, or creating a .zip file, it’s size exceeded 10mb so we could not upload it
on LMS.Instead, a short explanatory video showing execution and the outline of the program
is uploaded.

Project detail description including functionalities:

Data Structure: Trie

Applications: Auto-complete, spell checker, auto suggestion, dictionary, etc.

Why Trie data structure?
Trie is generally used to store strings. The main advantage is the complexity of insertion,
searching, deletion all have the same time complexity which is O(length of word). It is faster
than BST. It is also better than hashing, as it does not require any hash functions, and no
situation of collision arises
